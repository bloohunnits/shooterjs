# Setup and Running the Game

This guide will walk you through how to download the game files, navigate through the project directory, and either run or edit the game locally. We’ll use the terminal for cloning the repository, navigating through folders, and running the game in a web browser.

## 1. Cloning the Repository

To get the project onto your computer, you’ll need to clone the repository from GitHub. Here’s how you can do it:

### Step 1: Open the terminal (or command prompt)
- On **Windows**, press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, and hit **Enter**.
- On **Mac**, open **Terminal** from your Applications or by pressing `Cmd + Space` and searching for "Terminal."

### Step 2: Navigate to the folder where you want to clone the project
Before cloning, you need to decide where to store the project on your computer. You can navigate to any directory you want to work in using the `cd` command.

For example, if you want to store the project in your `dev` folder:
```bash
cd ~/dev
